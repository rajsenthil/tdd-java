# Test Driven Development with Java
Test Driven Development has 3 simple lifecycles.
1. Write simple test first
2. Implement it.
3. Fix the errors.
   * Compilation Error - Use IDE to fix. (Intellij and Eclipse can fix the error in no time.)
   * Test Failures     - Fix the **bugs**   
 
There could also be 4th lifecycle for refactoring. It is applied as and when needed.


## TDD with Array rotation in Java
In a given array rotate it in counter clockwise (alternate to this at later stage).



### Pros
1. Defects/Bugs are reduced
2. Code is cleaner with better design
3. Faster development
4. Code coverage quality is better. 

### Cons
1. It takes time and practice to adapt
2. The upfront time spent is longer.
3. It just a tool and not the savior. (same is true having 80% or 100% code coverage)
